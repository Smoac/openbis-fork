If you run the integration test from a branch which does not have a datamover, 
you should put a datamover distribution (which has the pattern 'datamover-*.zip') here
and run the integration tests from the command line the followin way:

	./run.sh --etl --lims --local-source --reinstall-all
	
Or just run the Eclipse 'External Tool': "Launch branch integration tests - rebuild local openBIS and ETL"
