/**
 * A download server interface. The interface defines methods a download client can use to download files from the server. Methods in this interface
 * have been designed specifically with reliability and high-performance in mind. To enable effective downloads of very large files, the files are cut
 * into pieces called chunks. Each chunk is downloaded individually and can be re-downloaded in case of any problems without a need of restarting the
 * whole file. To increase the performance of downloads multiple chunks can be downloaded in parallel via multiple download streams (each download
 * stream can be controlled by a separate thread in a download client). Separate download streams can also increase the overall performance in
 * networks with bandwidth throttling. Usage:
 * <ul>
 * <li>start a download session for given download items using {@link #startDownloadSession(IUserSessionId, List, DownloadPreferences)} method</li>
 * <li>queue chunks to be downloaded using {@link #queue(DownloadSessionId, List)} method</li>
 * <li>download the queued chunks using {@link #download(DownloadSessionId, DownloadStreamId, Integer)} method</li>
 * <li>in case the download of some chunks fails {@link #queue(DownloadSessionId, List)} and
 * {@link #download(DownloadSessionId, DownloadStreamId, Integer)} methods can be called again to re-queue and re-download problematic chunks
 * respectively</li>
 * <li>finish a download session using {@link #finishDownloadSession(DownloadSessionId)} method</li>
 * </ul>

     * Starts a download session to fetch items with given ids. Basing on the ids items are first found and then sliced into chunks (the way items are
     * found as well as the chunk size depends on the actual server implementation). Each created chunk is assigned a sequence number. Chunks that
     * constitute a single item always have consecutive sequence numbers. Therefore an item can be represented as a range of chunks (limited by
     * "start" and "end" sequence numbers). Ranges of all items are returned as part of {@link DownloadSession}. Before chunks can be downloaded

     *            download server implementation)

     *            of download streams usually increases the overall download performance, still it requires additional resources at both download
     *            client and download server sides. Therefore, a server may ignore a wish and permit fewer streams than requested (e.g. in case it is
     *            under a heavy load). Ids of permitted download streams are returned as part of the {@link DownloadSession}.
