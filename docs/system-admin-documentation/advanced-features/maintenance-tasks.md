## Introduction

A maintenance task is a process which runs once or in regular time
intervals. It is defined by a [core
plugin](/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=80699503) of type
`maintenance-tasks`. Usually a maintenance task can only run on AS or
DSS but not in both environments.

The following properties are common for all maintenance tasks:

|Property Key|Description|
|--- |--- |
|class|The fully-qualified Java class name of the maintenance task. The class has to implement IMaintenanceTask.|
|execute-only-once|A flag which has to be set to true if the task should be executed only once. Default value: false|
|interval|A time interval (in seconds) which defines the pace of execution of the maintenance task. Can be specified with one of the following time units: ms, msec, s, sec, m, min, h, hours, d, days. Default time unit is sec. Default value: one day.|
|start|A time at which the task should be executed the first time. Format: HH:mm. where HH is a two-digit hour (in 24h notation) and mm is a two-digit minute. By default the task is execute at server startup.|
|run-schedule|Scheduling plan for task execution. Properties execute-only-once, interval, and start will be ignored if specified.<br /><br />**Crontab syntax:** <br /><br />`cron: <second> <minute> <hour> <day> <month> <weekday>`<br /><br />Examples:<br /><br />`cron: 0 0 * * * *`: the top of every hour of every day.<br /><br />`cron: */10 * * * * *`: every ten seconds.<br /><br />`cron: 0 0 8-10 * * *`: 8, 9 and 10 o'clock of every day.<br /><br />`cron: 0 0 6,19 * * *`: 6:00 AM and 7:00 PM every day.<br /><br />`cron: 0 0/30 8-10 * * *`: 8:00, 8:30, 9:00, 9:30, 10:00 and 10:30 every day.<br /><br />`cron: 0 0 9-17 * * MON-FRI`: on the hour nine-to-five weekdays.<br /><br />`cron: 0 0 0 25 12 ?`: every Christmas Day at midnight.<br /><br />**Non-crontab syntax:** <br /><br />Comma-separated list of definitions with following syntax:<br /><br />`[[<counter>.]<week day>] [<month day>[.<month>]] <hour>[:<minute>]` <br /><br />where `<counter>` counts the specified week day of the month. `<week day>` is `MO`, `MON`, `TU`, `TUE`, `WE`, `WED`, `TH`, `THU`, `FR`, `FRI`, `SA`, `SAT`, `SU`, or `SUN` (ignoring case). `<month>` is either the month number (followed by an optionl '.') or `JAN`, `FEB`, `MAR`, `APR`, `MAY`, `JUN`, `JUL`, `AUG`, `SEP`, `OCT`, `NOV`, or `DEC` (ignoring case). <br /><br />Examples: <br /><br />`6, 18`: every day at 6 AM and 6 PM. <br /><br />`3.FR 22:15`: every third friday of a month at 22:15. <br /><br />`1. 15:50`: every first day of a month at 3:50 PM. <br /><br />`SAT 1:30`: every saturday at 1:30 AM. <br /><br />`1.Jan 5:15, 1.4. 5:15, 1.7 5:15, 1. OCT 5:15`: every first day of a quarter at 5:15 AM.|
|run-schedule-file|File where the timestamp for next execution is stored. It is used if run-schedule is specified. Default: `<installation folder>/<plugin name>_<class name>` |
|retry-intervals-after-failure|Optional comma-separated list of time intervals (format as for interval) after which a failed execution will be retried. Note, that a maintenance task will be execute always when the next scheduled timepoint occurs. This feature allows to execute a task much earlier in case of temporary errors (e.g. temporary unavailibity of another server).|

## Feature

### ArchivingByRequestTask

**Environment**: AS

**Relevancy:** Relevant

**Description**: Triggers archiving for data sets where the 'requested
archiving' flag is set. Waits with archiving until enough data sets for
a group come together. This is necessary for taped-base archiving where
the files to be stored have to be larger than a minimum size.

**Configuration**:

|Property Key|Description|
|--- |--- |
|keep-in-store|If true the archived data set will not be removed from the store. That is, only a backup will be created. Default: false|
|minimum-container-size-in-bytes|Minimum size of an archive container which has one or more data set. This is important for Multi Data Set Archiving. Default: 10 GB|
|maximum-container-size-in-bytes|Maximum size of an archive container which has one or more data set. This is important for Multi Data Set Archiving. Default: 80 GB|
|configuration-file-path|Path to the configuration file as used by User Group Management. Here only the group keys are needed. They define a set of groups. If there is no configuration file at the specified path this set is empty.A data set requested for archiving belongs the a specified group if its space starts with the group key followed by an underscore character '_'. Otherwise it belongs to no group. This maintenance task triggers archiving an archive container with one or more data set from the same group if the container fits the specified minimum and maximum size. Note, that data sets which do not belong to a group are handled as a group too. If a data set is larger than the maximum container size it will be archived even though the container is to large. The group key (in lower case) is provided to the archiver. The Multi Data Set Archiver will use this for storing the archive container in a sub folder of the same name.<br /><br /><br />Default: `etc/user-management-maintenance-config.json` |


**Example**:

**plugin.properties**

```
class = ch.systemsx.cisd.openbis.generic.server.task.ArchivingByRequestTask
interval = 1 d
minimum-container-size-in-bytes =  20000000000
maximum-container-size-in-bytes = 200000000000
configuration-file-path = ../../../data/groups.json
```


**Notes:**  In practice every instance using multi dataset archiving
feature and also the ELN-LIMS should have this enabled.

### AutoArchiverTask 

**Environment**: DSS

**Relevancy:** Rare

**Description**: Triggers archiving of data sets that have not been
archived yet.

**Configuration**:

|Property Key|Description|
|--- |--- |
|remove-datasets-from-store|If true the archived data set will be removed from the store. Default: false|
|data-set-type|Data set type of the data sets to be archived. If undefined all data set of all types might be archived.|
|older-than|Minimum number of days a data set to be archived hasn't been accessed. Default: 30|
|archive-candidate-discoverer.class|Discoverer of candidates to be archived:<ul><li>`ch.systemsx.cisd.etlserver.plugins.AgeArchiveCandidateDiscoverer`: All data sets with an access time stamp older than specified by property older-than are candidates. This is the default discoverer.</li><li>`ch.systemsx.cisd.etlserver.plugins.TagArchiveCandidateDiscoverer`: All data sets which are marked by one of the tags specified by the property `archive-candidate-discoverer.tags` are candidates.</li></ul> |
|policy.class|A policy specifies which data set candidates should be archived. If undefined all candidates will be archived. Has to be a fully-qualified name of a Java class implementing ch.systemsx.cisd.etlserver.IAutoArchiverPolicy.|
|policy.*|Properties specific for the policy specified by `policy.class`. More about policies can be found here.|

**Example**:

**plugin.properties**

```
class = ch.systemsx.cisd.etlserver.plugins.AutoArchiverTask
interval = 10 days
archive-candidate-discoverer.class = ch.systemsx.cisd.etlserver.plugins.TagArchiveCandidateDiscoverer
archive-candidate-discoverer.tags = /admin-user/archive
policy.class = ch.systemsx.cisd.etlserver.plugins.GroupingPolicy
policy.minimal-archive-size = 1500000
policy.maximal-archive-size = 3000000
policy.grouping-keys = Space#DataSetType, Space#Experiment:merge
```


### BlastDatabaseCreationMaintenanceTask 

**Environment**: DSS

**Relevancy:** Default (ELN-LIMS)

**Description**: Creates BLAST databases from FASTA and FASTQ files of
data sets and/or properties of experiments, samples, and data sets.

The title of all entries of the FASTA and FASTQ files will be extended
by the string `[Data set: <data set code>, File: <path>]`. Sequences
provide by an entity property will have identifiers of the form
`<entity kind>+<perm id>+<property type>+<time stamp>`. This allows to
determine where the matching sequences are stored in openBIS. A sequence
can be a nucleic acid sequence or an amino acid sequence.

For each data set a BLAST nucl and prot databases will be created (if
not empty) by the tool `makeblastdb`. For all entities of a specified
kind and type one BLAST database (one for nucleic sequences and one
for amino acid sequences) will be created from the plain sequences
stored in the specified property (white spaces will be removed). In
addition an index is created by the tool `makembindex` if the sequence
file of the database (file type `.nsq`) is larger than 1MB. The name of
the databases are `<data set code>-nucl/prot`
and `<entity kind>+<entity type code>+<property type code>+<time stamp>-nucl/prot`.
These databases are referred in the virtual database `all-nucl` (file:
`all-nucl.nal`) and `all-prot` (file: `all-prot.pal`).

If a data set is deleted the corresponding BLAST nucl and prot databases
will be automatically removed the next time this maintenance task runs.
If an entity of specified type has been modified the BLAST databases
will be recalculated the next time this maintenance task runs.

Works only if BLAST+ tool suite has been installed. BLAST+ can be
downloaded from
<ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/>

**Notes:**  It comes pre-configured with the ELN-LIMS but if additional
properties need to scanned they should be added to the plugin.properties

  

**Configuration**:

|Property Key|Description|
|--- |--- |
|dataset-types|Comma-separated list of regular expressions of data set types. All FASTA and FASTQ files from those data sets are handled. All data sets of types not matching at least one of the regular expression are not handled.|
|entity-sequence-properties|Comma-separated list of descriptions of entity properties with sequences. A description is of the form<br /><br />`<entity kind>+<entity type code>+<property type code>`<br /><br />where `<entity kind>` is either `EXPERIMENT`, `SAMPLE` or `DATA_SET` (Materials are not supported).|
|file-types|Space separated list of file types. Data set files of those file types have to be FASTA or FASTQ files. Default: `.fasta` `.fa` `.fsa` `.fastq`|
|blast-tools-directory|Path in the file system where all BLAST tools are located. If it is not specified or empty the tools directory has to be in the PATH environment variable.|
|blast-databases-folder|Path to the folder where all BLAST databases are stored. Default: `<data store root>/blast-databases`|
|blast-temp-folder|Path to the folder where temporary FASTA files are stored.  Default: `<blast-databases-folder>/tmp` |
|last-seen-data-set-file|Path to the file which stores the id of the last seen data set. Default: `<data store root>/last-seen-data-set-for-BLAST-database-creation` |

Default: No data set type is excluded.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| estimated-data-set-size-in-KB.<data set type> | Specifies for the data set type <data set type> the average size in KB. If <data set type> is DEFAULT it will be used for all data set types with unspecified estimated size.                                                                                                                                    |
| free-space-provider.class                           | Fully qualified class name of the free space provider (implementing `ch.systemsx.cisd.common.filesystem.IFreeSpaceProvider`). Depending on the free space provider additional properties, all starting with prefix `free-space-provider`.,  might be needed. Default: `ch.systemsx.cisd.common.filesystem.SimpleFreeSpaceProvider` |
| monitored-dir                                       | Path to the directory to be monitored by the free space provider.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| minimum-free-space-in-MB                            | Minimum free space in MB. If the free space is below this limit the task archives data sets. Default: 1 GB                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

**Example**:

**plugin.properties**

```
class = ch.systemsx.cisd.etlserver.plugins.ExperimentBasedArchivingTask
interval = 86400
minimum-free-space-in-MB = 2048
monitored-dir = /my-data/
estimated-data-set-size-in-KB.RAW_DATA = 12000
estimated-data-set-size-in-KB.DEFAULT = 35000
```

     

If there is not enough free space the task archives all data sets
experiment by experiment until free space is above the specified limit.
The oldest experiments are archived first. The age of an experiment is
determined by the youngest modification/registration time stamp of all
its data sets which are not excluded by data set type or archiving
status.

The free space is only calculated once when the task starts to figure
out whether archiving is necessary or not. This value is than used
together with estimated data set sizes to get an estimated free space
which is used for the stopping criteria. Why not calculating the free
space again with the free space provider after the data sets of an
experiment have been archived? The reason is that providing the free
space might be an expensive operation. This is the case when archiving
means removing data from a database which have been fed by data from
data sets of certain type. In this case archiving (i.e. deleting) those
data in the database do not automatically frees disk space because
freeing disk space is for databases often an expensive operation.

The DSS admin will be informed by an e-mail about which experiments have
been archived.

### MultiDataSetDeletionMaintenanceTask 

**Environment**: DSS

**Relevancy:** Relevant

**Description**: Deletes data sets which are already deleted on AS also
from multi-data-set archives. This maintenance task works only if the
[Multi Data Set Archiver](/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=80699422)  is
configured. It does the following:

1.  Extracts the not-deleted data sets of a TAR container with deleted
    data sets into the store.
2.  Marks them as *not present in archive*.
3.  Deletes the TAR containers with deleted data sets.
4.  Requests archiving of the non-deleted data sets.

The last step requires that the maintenance task
[ArchivingByRequestTask](#MaintenanceTasks-ArchivingByRequestTask) is
configured.

**Configuration**:

### PathInfoDatabaseFeedingTask 

**Environment**: DSS

**Relevancy:** Default, is part of the post registration task

**Description**: Feeds the pathinfo database with file paths of all data
sets in the store. It can be used as a maintenance task as well as a
post registration task. As a maintenance task it is needed to run only
once if a **PostRegistrationMaintenanceTask** is configured. This task
assumes a data source with for 'path-info-db'.

If used as a maintenance task the data sets are processed in the order
they are registered. The registration time stamp of the last processed
data set is the starting point when the task is executed next time.

**Configuration**:

|Property Key|Description|
|--- |--- |
|compute-checksum|If `true` the CRC32 checksum (and optionally a checksum of the type specified by `checksum-type`) of all files will be calculated and stored in pathinfo database. Default value: `false` |
|checksum-type|Optional checksum type. If specified and `compute-checksum = true` two checksums are calculated: CRC32 checksum and the checksum of specified type. The type and the checksum are stored in the pathinfo database. An allowed type has to be supported by `MessageDigest.getInstance(<checksum type>)`. For more details see [Oracle docs](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/MessageDigest.html#getInstance-java.lang.String-).|
|data-set-chunk-size|Number of data sets requested from AS in one chunk if it is used as a maintenance task. Default: 1000|
|max-number-of-chunks|Maximum number of chunks of size data-set-chunk-size are processed if it is used as a maintenance task. If it is <= 0 and `time-limit` isn't defined all data sets are processed. Default: 0|
|time-limit|Limit of execution time of this task if it is used as a maintenance task. The task is stopped before reading next chunk if the time has been used up. If it is specified it is an alternative way to limit the number of data sets to be processed instead of specifying  `max-number-of-chunks`. This parameter can be specified with one of the following time units: `ms`, `msec`, `s`, `sec`, `m`, `min`, `h`, `hours`, `d`, `days`. Default time unit is `sec`.|

## Consistency and other Reports

### DataSetArchiverOrphanFinderTask 

**Environment**: DSS

**Relevancy:** Rare

**Description**: Finds archived data sets which are no longer in openBIS
(at least not marked as present-in-archive). A report will be created
and sent to the specified list of e-mail addresses (mandatory
property `email-addresses`). The task also looks for data sets which are
present-in-archive but actually not found in the archive.

This orphan finder task only works for Multi Data Set Archiver. It
doesn't work for RsyncArchiver, TarArchiver or ZipArchiver.

**Configuration**:

**plugin.properties**

```
class = ch.systemsx.cisd.etlserver.plugins.DataSetArchiverOrphanFinderTask
interval = 60 s
email-addresses = email1@bsse.ethz.ch, email2@bsse.ethz.ch
```


**Notes:** This is a consistency check task. It checks consistency for
datasets with the flag present-in-archive.

### DataSetAndPathInfoDBConsistencyCheckTask 

**Environment**: DSS

**Relevancy:** Rare

**Description**: Checks that the file information in pathinfo database
is consistent with the information the file system provides. This is
done for all recently registered data sets. Note, archived data sets are
skipped. After all data sets (in the specified checking time interval)
have been checked the task checks them again.

**Configuration**:

|Property Key|Description|
|--- |--- |
|checking-time-interval|Time interval in the past which defines the range of data sets to be checked. That is, all data sets with registration date between now minus checking-time-interval and now will be checked. Can be specified with one of the following time units: `ms`, `msec`, `s`, `sec`, `m`, `min`, `h`, `hours`, `d`, `days`. Default time unit is `sec`. Default value: one day.|
|pausing-time-point|Optional time point. Format: `HH:mm`. where `HH` is a two-digit hour (in 24h notation) and `mm` is a two-digit minute.<br /><br />When specified this task stops checking after the specified pausing time point and continues when executed the next time or the next day if start or `continuing-time-point` is specified.<br /><br />After all data sets have been checked the task checks again all data sets started by the oldest one specified by `checking-time-interval`.|
|continuing-time-point|Time point where checking continous. Format: `HH:mm`. where `HH` is a two-digit hour (in 24h notation) and `mm` is a two-digit minute. Ignored when `pausing-time-point` isn't specified. Default value: Time when the task is executed.|
|chunk-size|Maximum number of data sets retrieved from AS. Ignored when `pausing-time-point` isn't specified. Default value: 1000|
|state-file|File to store registration time stamp and code of last considered data set. This is only used when pausing-time-point has been specified. Default: `<store root>/DataSetAndPathInfoDBConsistencyCheckTask-state.txt` |


**Example**: The following example checks all data sets of the last ten
years. It does the check only during the night and continues next night.

**plugin.properties**

```
class = ch.systemsx.cisd.etlserver.path.DataSetAndPathInfoDBConsistencyCheckTask
interval = 1 days
start = 23:15
pausing-time-point = 5:00
checking-time-interval = 3653 days
```


### MaterialExternalDBSyncTask

**Environment**: AS

**Relevancy:** Deprecated

**Description**: Feeds a report database with recently added or modified
materials.

**Configuration**:

|Property Key|Description|
|--- |--- |
|database-driver|Fully qualified name of the JDBC driver class.|
|database-url|URL to access the database server.|
|database-username|User name of the database. Default: User who started openBIS AS.|
|database-password|Optional password of the database user.|
|mapping-file|Path to the file containing configuration information of mapping material types and material properties to tables and columns in the report database.|
|read-timestamp-sql|The SQL select statement which returns one column of type time stamp for the time stamp of the last report. If the result set is empty the time stamp is assumed to be 1970-01-01. If the result set has more than one row the first row is used.|
|update-timestamp-sql|The SQL statement which updates or adds a time stamp. The statement has to contain a '?' symbol as the placeholder of the actual time stamp.|
|insert-timestamp-sql|The SQL statement to add a time stamp the first time. The statement has to contain a '?' symbol as the placeholder of the actual time stamp. Default: same as `update-timestamp-sql`.|

**Example**:

**service.properties of AS**

```
<task id>.class = ch.systemsx.cisd.openbis.generic.server.task.MaterialExternalDBSyncTask
<task id>.interval = 120
<task id>.read-timestamp-sql = select timestamp from timestamp
<task id>.update-timestamp-sql = update timestamp set timestamp = ?
<task id>.insert-timestamp-sql = insert into timestamp values(?)
<task id>.mapping-file = ../report-mapping.txt
<task id>.database-driver = org.postgresql.Driver
<task id>.database-url = jdbc:postgresql://localhost/material_reporting
```


#### Mapping File

The mapping file is a text file describing the mapping of the data (i.e.
material codes and material properties) onto the report database. It
makes several assumptions on the database schema:

-   One table per material type. There are only table of materials to be
    reported.
-   Each table has a column which contains the material code.  
    -   The entries are unique.
    -   The material code is a string not longer than 60 characters.
-   Each table has one column for each property type. Again, there are
    only column for properties to be reported.
-   The data type of the column should match the data type of the
    properties:
    -   MATERIAL:  only the material code (string) will be reported.
        Maximum length: 60
    -   CONTROLLEDVOCABULARY: the label (if defined) or the code will be
        reported. Maximum length: 128
    -   TIMESTAMP: timestamp
    -   INTEGER: integer of any number of bits (maximum 64).
    -   REAL: fixed or floating point number 
    -   all other data types are mapped to text.


The general format of the mapping file is as follows:
```
[<Material Type Code>: <table Name>, <code column
name>]

<Property Type Code>: <column name>

<Property Type Code>: <column name>

...

[<Material Type Code>: <table Name>, <code column
name>]

<Property Type Code>: <column name>

<Property Type Code>: <column name>

...
```

 Example:

**mapping.txt**

```
# Some comments
[GENE: GENE, GENE_ID]
GENE_SYMBOLS: symbol

[SIRNA: si_rna, code]
INHIBITOR_OF: suppressed_gene
SEQUENCE: Nucleotide_sequence
```


Some rules:

-   Empty lines and lines starting with '\#' will be ignored.
-   Table and column names can be upper or lower case or mixed.
-   Material type codes and property type codes have to be in upper
    case.

```{warning}
If you put a foreign key constraint on the material code of one of the material properties, you need to define the constraint checking as DEFERRED in order to not get a constraint violation. The reason is that this task will *not* order the `INSERT` statements by its dependencies, but in alphabetical order.
```

### UsageReportingTask

**Environment**: AS

**Relevancy:** Relevant

**Description**: Creates a daily/weekly/monthly report to a list of
e-mail recipients about the usage (i.e. creation of experiments, samples

task is only needed when `create-continuous-sample-codes` is set `true`
in `service.properties` of AS.

**Example**:

**plugin.properties**

`class = ch.systemsx.cisd.openbis.generic.server.task.BatchSampleRegistrationTempCodeUpdaterTask`

### CleanUpUnarchivingScratchShareTask 

**Environment**: DSS

**Relevancy:** Default

**Description**: Removes data sets from the unarchiving scratch share
which have status ARCHIVED and which are present in archive. For more
details see [Multi data set
archiving](/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=80699422).

**Configuration**:

**plugin.properties**

```
class = ch.systemsx.cisd.openbis.dss.generic.server.plugins.standard.archiver.CleanUpUnarchivingScratchShareTask
interval = 60 s
```


**Notes:** Recommended cleanup task to run on every instance.

### DataSetRegistrationSummaryTask 

**Environment**: AS

**Relevancy:** Rare

**Description**: Sends a data set summary report to a list of e-mail
recipients in regular time intervals. The report contains all new data
sets registered since the last report. Selected properties can be
included into the report. The data sets are grouped by the data set
type.

In order to be able to send an e-mail the following properties in
`service.properties` have to be defined:

```
mail.from = openbis@<host>
mail.smtp.host = <SMTP host>
mail.smtp.user = <can be empty>
mail.smtp.password = <can be empty>
```


**Configuration:**


|Property Key|Description|
|--- |--- |
|interval|Interval (in seconds) between regular checks whether to create a report or not. This value should be set to 86400 (1 day). Otherwise the same report might be sent twice or no report will be sent.|
|start|Time the report will be created. A good values for this parameter is some early time in the morning like in the example below.|
|days-of-week|Comma-separated list of numbers denoting days of week (Sunday=1, Monday=2, etc.). This parameter should be used if reports should be sent weekly or more often.|
|days-of-month|Comma-separated list of numbers denoting days of month. Default value of this parameter is 1.|
|email-addresses|Comma-separated list of e-mail addresses.|
|shown-data-set-properties|Optional comma-separated list of data set properties to be included into the report.|
|data-set-types|Restrict the report to the specified comma-separated data set types.|
|configured-content|Use the specified content as the body of the email.|


A report is sent at each day which is either a specified day of week or
day of month. If only weekly reports are needed the parameter
`days-of-month` should be set to an empty string.

**Example**:

**service.properties of AS**

```
<task id>.class = ch.systemsx.cisd.openbis.generic.server.task.DataSetRegistrationSummaryTask
<task id>.interval = 86400
<task id>.start = 1:00
<task id>.data-set-types = RAW_DATA, MZXML_DATA
<task id>.email-addresses = albert.einstein@princeton.edu, charles.darwin@evolution.org

**Description**: Re-evaluates dynamic properties of all samples which
refer via properties of type MATERIAL directly or indirectly to
materials changed since the last re-evaluation.

**Configuration**:

|Property Key|Description|
|--- |--- |
|class|`ch.systemsx.cisd.openbis.generic.server.task.DynamicPropertyEvaluationTriggeredByMaterialChangeMaintenanceTask`|
|timestamp-file|Path to a file which will store the timestamp of the last evaluation. Default value: `../../../data/DynamicPropertyEvaluationTriggeredByMaterialChangeMaintenanceTask-timestamp.txt`.|
|initial-timestamp|Initial timestamp of the form `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g. 2013-09-15) which will be used the first time when the timestamp file doesn't exist or has an invalid value. This is a mandatory property.|

**Example**:

**plugin.properties**

```
class = ch.systemsx.cisd.openbis.generic.server.task.DynamicPropertyEvaluationTriggeredByMaterialChangeMaintenanceTask
interval = 7 days
initial-timestamp = 2012-12-31
```


### FillUnknownDataSetSizeInOpenbisDBFromPathInfoDBMaintenanceTask 

**Environment**: DSS

**Relevancy:** Rare

**Description**: Queries openBIS database to find data sets without a
size filled in, then queries the pathinfo DB to see if the size info is
available there; if it is available, it fills in the size from the
pathinfo information. If it is not available, it does nothing. Data sets
from openBIS database are fetched in chunks (see data-set-chunk-size
property). After each chunk the maintenance tasks checks whether a time
limit has been reached (see time-limit property). If so, it stops
processing. A code of the last processed data set is stored in a file
(see last-seen-data-set-file property). The next run of the maintenance
task will process data sets with a code greater than the one saved in
the "last-seen-data-set-file". This file is deleted periodically (see
delete-last-seen-data-set-file-interval) to handle a situation where
codes of new data sets are lexicographically smaller than the codes of
the old datasets. Deleting the file is also needed when pathinfo
database entries are added after a data set has been already processed
by the maintenance task. 

**Configuration**:


|Property Key|Description|
|--- |--- |
|last-seen-data-set-file|Path to a file that will store a code of the last handled data set. Default value: "fillUnknownDataSetSizeTaskLastSeen"|
|delete-last-seen-data-set-file-interval|A time interval (in seconds) which defines how often the "last-seen-data-set-file" file should be deleted. The parameter can be specified with one of the following time units:  `ms`, `msec`, `s`, `sec`, `m`, `min`, `h`, `hours`, `d`, `days`. Default time unit is `sec`. Default value: 7 days.|
|data-set-chunk-size|Number of data sets requested from AS in one chunk. Default: 100|
|time-limit|Limit of execution time of this task. The task is stopped before reading next chunk if the time has been used up. This parameter can be specified with one of the following time units: `ms`, `msec`, `s`, `sec`, `m`, `min`, `h`, `hours`, `d`, `days`. Default time unit is `sec`.|

**Example:**

**plugin.properties**

```
<task id>.class = ch.systemsx.cisd.etlserver.plugins.FillUnknownDataSetSizeInOpenbisDBFromPathInfoDBMaintenanceTask
<task id>.interval = 86400
<task id>.data-set-chunk-size = 1000
<task id>.time-limit = 1h
```


**NOTE**: Useful in scenarios where the path info feeding sub task of
post registration task fails.

### PathInfoDatabaseChecksumCalculationTask

**Environment**: DSS

**Relevancy:** Rare, often the CRC32 is calculated during the post
registration.

**Description**: Calculates the CRC32 checksum (and optionally a
checksum of specified type) of all files in the pathinfo database with
unknown checksum. This task is needed to run only once. It assumes a
data source for key 'path-info-db'. 

**Configuration**:

|Property Key|Description|
|--- |--- |
|checksum-type|Optional checksum type. If specified two checksums are calculated: CRC32 checksum and the checksum of specified type. The type and the checksum are stored in the pathinfo database. An allowed type has to be supported by `MessageDigest.getInstance(<checksum type>)`. For more details see http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/MessageDigest.html#getInstance-java.lang.String-.|

**Example**:

**plugin.properties**

```
class = ch.systemsx.cisd.etlserver.path.PathInfoDatabaseChecksumCalculationTask
execute-only-once = true
checksum-type = SHA-256
```


### PathInfoDatabaseRefreshingTask

**Environment**: DSS

**Relevancy:** Rare

**Description**: Refreshes the pathinfo database with file metadata of
physical and available data sets in the store. This task assumes a data
source with for 'path-info-db'.

The data sets are processed in the inverse order they are registered.
Only a maximum number of data sets are processed in one run. This is
specified by `chunk-size`.

```{warning}
Under normal circumstances this maintenance task is never needed, because the content of a physical data set is **never** changed by openBIS itself.<br /><br />Only in the rare cases that the content of physical data sets have to be changed this maintenance task allows to refresh the file meta data in the pathinfo database.
```

**Configuration**:

|Property Key|Description|
|--- |--- |
|time-stamp-of-youngest-data-set|Time stamp of the youngest data set to be considered. The format has to be `<4 digit year>-<month>-<day> <hour>:<minute>:<second>`.|
|compute-checksum|If `true` the CRC32 checksum (and optionally a checksum of the type specified by `checksum-type`) of all files will be calculated and stored in pathinfo database. Default value: true|
|checksum-type|Optional checksum type. If specified and `compute-checksum = true` two checksums are calculated: CRC32 checksum and the checksum of specified type. The type and the checksum are stored in the pathinfo database. An allowed type has to be supported by `MessageDigest.getInstance(<checksum type>)`. For more details see [Oracle doc](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/MessageDigest.html#getInstance-java.lang.String-).|
|chunk-size|Number of data sets requested from AS in one chunk. Default: 1000|
|data-set-type|Optional data set type. If specified, only data sets of the specified type are considered. Default: All data set types.|
|state-file|File to store registration time stamp and code of last considered data set. Default: `<store root>/PathInfoDatabaseRefreshingTask-state.txt`|

**Example**:

**plugin.properties**

```
class = ch.systemsx.cisd.etlserver.path.PathInfoDatabaseRefreshingTask
interval = 30 min
time-stamp-of-youngest-data-set = 2014-01-01 00:00:00
data-set-type = HCS_IMAGE
```
