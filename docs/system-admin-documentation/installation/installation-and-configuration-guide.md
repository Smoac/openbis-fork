Installation and Administrator Guide of the openBIS Server
==========================================================

## System Requirements

The minimal requirements of a system running openBIS are:

- Operating System: Linux / MacOS X (The binaries: `bash`, `awk`, `sed`, `unzip` need to be installed and in the `PATH` of the openBIS user.)
- Java Runtime Environment: recent versions of Oracle JRE 11
- PostgreSQL 11

We find Linux to be the easiest choice to get an openBIS server running quickly.

For recommended memory settings, see [Recommended CPU and memory settings for openBIS 20.10](./system-requirements.md).

An SMTP server needs to be accessible and configured if you want to obtain notifications.

## Installation

The server distribution is a `gzipped` `tar` file named `openBIS-installation-standard-technologies-<version>` `.tar.gz`. It contains:

- `console.properties:` configuration file for a console/non-gui installation

- `extract.sh:` helper script for installation

- `jul.config:` Log configuration for the openBIS install process

- `openBIS-installer.jar` Java archive containing openBIS

- `run-console.sh` Installation script for console/non-gui installation

- `run-ui.sh` Installation script for gui installation

### Installation steps

1. Create a service user account, i.e. an unprivileged, regular user account. **Do not run openBIS as root!**

2. Gunzip the distribution on the server machine into some temporary folder.

3. Run either the console/non-gui installation script or the gui installation script:

    **GUI-based installation**

    ```bash
    tar xvfz openBIS-installation-standard-technologies-S139.0-r26480.tar.gz
    cd openBIS-installation-standard-technologies-S139.0-r26480
    ./run-ui.sh
    ```

    In the non-gui version you have to edit the `console.properties`
    files:

    **Non-GUI installation**

    ```bash
    tar xvfz openBIS-installation-standard-technologies-S139.0-r26480.tar.gz
    cd openBIS-installation-standard-technologies-S139.0-r26480
    vi console.properties
    ./run-console.sh
    ```
    
    ```{note}
    Please be aware that the directory where openbis is installed should not already exist. Users should specify the directory where they want to install openBIS (in the console.properties or in the graphical installer) and this directory will be created by the installation procedure. If the directory already exists, the installation will fail.
    ```

After the successful installation you should have a look at the configuration file called s`ervice.properties`. It is located in `<server_folder>openBIS-server/jetty/etc/`

This file is a an [Extended Properties File](./optional-application-server-configuration.md). Here is an example which can be used as a template:

### Database Settings

All properties starting with `database.` specify the settings for the openBIS database. They are all mandatory.

| Property                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `database.engine`                  | Type of database. Currently only postgresql is supported.                                                                                                                                                            |
| `database.create-from-scratch`     | If true the database will be dropped and an empty database will be created. In productive use always set this value to  false  .                                                                                     |
| `database.script-single-step-mode` | If true all SQL scripts are executed in single step mode. Useful for localizing errors in SQL scripts. Should be always false in productive mode.                                                                    |
| `database.url-host-part`           | Part of JDBC URL denoting the host of the database server. If openBIS Application Server and database server are running on the same machine this property should be an empty string.                                |
| `database.kind`                    | Part of the name of the database. The full name reads openbis_<  kind  >.                                                                                                                                      |
| `database.admin-user`              | ID of the user on database server with admin rights, like creation of tables. Should be an empty string if default admin user should be used. In case of PostgreSQL the default admin user is assumed to be postgres. |
| database.admin-password          | Password for admin user. Usual an empty string.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `database.owner`                   | ID of the user owning the data. This should generally be openbis. The openbis role and password need to be created. In case of an empty string it is the same user who started up openBIS Application Server.        |
| `database.owner-password`          | Password of the owner.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
```{warning}
The credentials for the database user with the privilege to create a new database depends on the installation and configuration of the PostgreSQL database.
```

## Start Server

The server is started as follows:

```console
prompt> <installation folder>/bin/bisup.sh
```

On startup the openBIS server creates the database on PostgreSQL and
checks the connection with the remote authentication services (if they
are configured). Log files can be found in
`<installation folder>/servers/openBIS-server/jetty/logs`. Also the
following command shows the log: `<installation folder>/bin/bislog.sh`

```{warning}
The first user logged in into the system will have full administrator rights (role `INSTANCE_ADMIN`).
```

## Stop Server

The server is stopped as follows:

```console
prompt> <installation folder>/bin/bisdown.sh
```

## Authentication systems

Generic openBIS currently supports four authentication systems: a
self-contained system based on a UNIX-like passwd file, LDAP, the Crowd
system (see <http://www.atlassian.com/software/crowd>) and Single Sign
On (eg SWITCH AAI). Beside this there are also so called stacked
authentication methods available. Stacked authentication methods use
multiple authentication systems in the order indicated by the name. The
first authentication system being able to provide an entry for a
particular user id will be used. If you need full control over what
authentication systems are used in what order, you can define your own
stacked authentication service in the Spring application context file:
`<server folder>/openBIS-server/jetty/webapps/openbis/WEB-INF/classes/genericCommonContext.xml.`

### The default authentication configuration

In the template service properties, we set
`authentication-service = file-ldap-crowd-caching-authentication-service`,
which means that file-based authentication, LDAP and Crowd are used for
authentication, in this order. As LDAP and Crowd are not configured in
the template service properties, this effectively corresponds
to `file-authentication-service`, however when LDAP and / or Crowd are
configured, they are picked up on server start and are used to
authenticate users when they are not found in the local `passwd` file.
Furthermore, as it is a caching authentication service, it will cache
authentication results from LDAP and / or Crowd in
`file <server folder>/jetty/etc/passwd_cache`. See section
*Authentication Cache* below for details on this caching.

### The file based authentication system

This authentication schema uses the file
`<server folder>/jetty/etc/passwd` to determine whether a login to the
system is successful or not.

The script `<server folder>/jetty/bin/passwd.sh` can be used to maintain
this file. This script supports the options:

```bash
passwd list | [remove|show|test] <userid> | [add|change] <userid> [option [...]]
    --help                 : Prints out a description of the options.
    [-P,--change-password] : Read the new password from the console,
    [-e,--email] VAL       : Email address of the user.
    [-f,--first-name] VAL  : First name of the user.
    [-l,--last-name] VAL   : Last name of the user.
    [-p,--password] VAL    : The password.
```


A new user can be added with

```bash
prompt> passwd.sh add [-f <first name>] [-l <last name>] [-e <email>] [-p <password>] <username>
```

If no password is provided with the `-p` option, the system will ask for
a password of the new user on the console. Please note that providing a
password on the command line can be a security risk, because the
password can be found in the shell history, and, for a short time, in
the `ps` table. Thus `-p` is not recommended in normal operation.

The password of a user can be tested with

```bash
prompt> passwd.sh test <username>
```

The system will ask for the current password on the console and then
print whether the user was authenticated successfully or not.

An account can be changed with

```bash
prompt> passwd.sh change [-f <first name>] [-l <last name>] [-e <email>] [-P] <username>
```

An account can be removed with

```bash
prompt> passwd.sh remove <username>
```

The details of an account can be queried with

```bash
prompt> passwd.sh show <username>
```

All accounts can be listed with

```bash
prompt> passwd.sh list
```

The password file contains each user in a separate line. The fields of
each line are separated by colon and contain (in this order): *User Id*,
*Email Address*, *First Name*, *Last Name* and *Password Hash*.
The *Password Hash* field represents the
[salted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_hash)
[SHA1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha1) hash of the user's password in
[BASE64 encoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64).

### The interface to LDAP

To work with an LDAP server, you need to provide the server URL with
(example) and set the
`authentication-service = ldap-authentication-service`

```bash
ldap.server.url = ldap://d.ethz.ch/DC=d,DC=ethz,DC=ch
```

and the details of an LDAP account who is allowed to make queries on the
LDAP server with (example)

```bash
ldap.security.principal.distinguished.name = CN=carl,OU=EthUsers,DC=d,DC=ethz,DC=ch
ldap.security.principal.password = Carls_LDAP_Password
```


Note: A space-separated list of URLs can be provided if distinguished
name and password  are valid for all specified LDAP servers.

### The interface to Crowd

When setting `authentication-service = crowd-authentication-service` in
`service.properties`, the `passwd` file has no effect. Instead, the
following properties need to be configured via the following properties.

The URL (without port information):

    crowd.service.url = https://crowd.your.org

The Port of the URL:

    crowd.service.port = 443

The name of the application account in Crowd:

    crowd.application.name = openbis

The password of the application account in Crowd:

    crowd.application.password = <application password>

If Crowd is used as an authentication service, the IP of the openBIS
server and the name (of the openBIS application) has to be registered
with the Crowd server.

### Authentication Cache

If configuring a caching authentication service like
`file-ldap-crowd-caching-authentication-service`, authentication results
from remote authentication services like LDAP and / or Crowd are cached
locally in the openBIS Application Server. The advantage is a faster
login time on repeated logins when one or more remote authentication
services are slow. The disadvantage is that changes to data in the
remote authentication system (like a changed password or email address)
are becoming known to openBIS only with a delay. In order to minimize
this effect, the authentication caching performs "re-validation" of
authentication requests asynchronously. That means it doesn't block the
user from logging in because it is performed in different thread than
the login.

There are two service properties which give you control over the working
of the authentication cache:

- `authentication.cache.time` lets you set for how long (after putting
    it into the cache) a cache entry (read: "user name and password")
    will be kept if the user does not have a successful login to openBIS
    in this period of time (as successful logins will trigger
    re-validation and thus renewal of the cache entry). The default is
    28h, which means that users logging into the system every day will
    never experience a delay from slow remote authentication systems. A
    non-positive value will disable caching.
- `authentication.cache.time-no-revalidation` lets you set for how
    long (after putting it into the cache) a cache entry will *not* be
    re-validated if the login was successful. This allows you to reduce
    the load that openBIS creates on the remote authentication servers
    for successful logins of the same user. The default is 1h. Setting
    it to 0 will always trigger re-validation, setting it to
    `authentication.cache.time` will not perform re-validation at all
    and thus expire every cache entry after that time.

An administrator with shell access to the openBIS Application Server can
see and change the current cache entries in the
file `<server folder>/jetty/`etc/passwd\_cache. The format is the same
as for the file-based authentication system (see section *The file based
authentication system* above), but has an additional field *Cached At*
added to the end of each line. *Cached At* is the time (in milli-seconds
since start of the Unix epoch, which is midnight *Universal Time
Coordinated*, 1 January 1970) when the entry was cached. Removing a line
from this file will remove the corresponding cache entry. The
authentication cash survives openBIS Application Server restarts because
of this persisted file. If you need to clear the cache altogether, it is
sufficient to remove the `passwd_cache` file at any time. No server
restart is needed to make changes to this file take effect.

You can switch off authentication caching by either
setting `authentication.cache.time = -1`, or by choosing an
authentication service which does not have `caching` in its name.

### Anonymous Login

In order to allow anonymous login a certain user known by openBIS (not
necessarily by the authentication system) has to be specified. This is
done by the property `user-for-anonymous-login`. The value is the user
ID. The display settings and the authorization settings of this user are
used for the anonymous login.

Anonymous login is possible with URL parameter `anonymous` set to `true`
or by property `default-anonymous-login` in web configuration properties
(see [Web Client Customization](./installation-and-configuration-guide.md#web-client-customizations)). Note, that for the ELN client the property `default-anonymous-login` isn't used. Anonymous login needs only the property `user-for-anonymous-login` for an existing user with some rights.

### Single Sign On Authentication

Currently only Shibboleth SSO is supported. For more details see [Single Sign On Authentication](./installation-and-configuration-guide.md#single-sign-on-authentication).

## Authorization

openBIS authorization is described here: [Authorization](./installation-and-configuration-guide.md#authorization).

## System Customization

### Login Page - Banners

To add banners to the main OpenBIS change `loginHeader.html` page. It is
stored in the same directory as `index.html`. Note that if the height of
`loginHeader.html` is too big, the content may overlap with the rest of
the OpenBIS login page.

Example of the `loginHeader.html`:

    <center><img src="images/banner.gif"></center>

For announcements you have to edit the `index.html` file. Here is an
example showing the tail:

```html
<input style="margin-left: 200px" type="submit" id="openbis_login_submit" value="Login">
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="color:red">
Due the server maintenance openBIS 
<br>
will not be available on 24th of 
<br>
    December 2010 from 10 am to 3 pm!
<br>
</span>
</form>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```


Note: the current work around with `br` tags between the lines ensures
that the login box is still centered.

### Client Customization

#### Configuration

To reconfigure some parts of the openBIS Web Client and Data Set Upload
Client, prepare the configuration file and add the path to the value of
`web-client-configuration-file` property in openBIS
`service.properties`.

    web-client-configuration-file = etc/web-client.properties

#### Web client customizations

- Enable the trashcan. When the trashcan is enabled, deleting entities
    only marks them as deleted but not deletes them physically (it is
    also called "logical deletion"). When clicking on the trashcan icon
    in the Web GUI, the user can see all of his deletion operations and
    can revert them individually. Only an admin can empty the trashcan
    and thus delete the entities physically. Only with enabled trashcan
    is it possible to delete complete hierarchies (e.g. an experiment
    with samples and datasets attached).
- Default view mode (`SIMPLE/NORMAL`) that should be used if user
    doesn't have it specified in a URL.
- Replacement texts for 'Experiment' and 'Sample' by `experiment-text`
    and `sample-text`, respectively.
- Anonymous login by default.
- Sample, material, experiment and data set `detail views `can be
    customized by:
    - hiding the sections (e.g. attachments)
- Additionally `data set detail view` can be customized by:
    - removing `Smart View` and `File View` from the list of available
        reports in `Data View` section
- Technology specific properties with property `technologies` which is
    a comma-separated list of technologies. For each technology
    properties are defined where the property names start with
    technology name followed by a dot character.

#### Data Set Upload Client Customizations

It is possible to restrict the set of data set types available to the
user in the data set uploader. This is useful when there are some data
set types that a user would never upload; for example, if there are data
set types that are used only internally exist only to support
third-party software.

The restriction is specified in the web-client.properties file using
either a whitelist or a blacklist. If both are specified, the whitelist
is used. To specify a whitelist, use the key
`creatable-data-set-types-whitelist`; for a blacklist, use the key
`creatable-data-set-types-blacklist`. The value for the property should
be a comma-separated list of regular-expression patterns to match. In
the case of the whitelist, data set types that match the specified
patterns are shown to the user, whereas for the blacklist, the data set
types that match the specified patterns are those that are not shown to
the user.

##### Examples

- Specifying a whitelist

**web-client.properties.**

    creatable-data-set-types-whitelist = .*IMAGE.*, ANALYSIS, THUMBNAIL[0-9]?

Assume we have the following data set types in our system:

*PROCESSED-DATA*, *MICROSCOPE-IMAGE*, *IMAGE-SCREENING*, *ANALYSIS*,
*ANALYSIS-FEATURES*, *THUMBNAIL1*, *THUMBNAIL-BIG*

In this case, the follwing data set types will be available to the user:

*MICROSCOPE-IMAGE*, *IMAGE-SCREENING*, *ANALYSIS*, *THUMBNAIL1*

- Specifying a blacklist

**web-client.properties.**

    creatable-data-set-types-blacklist = .*IMAGE.*, ANALYSIS, THUMBNAIL[0-9]?

Assume we have the following data set types in our system:

*PROCESSED-DATA*, *MICROSCOPE-IMAGE*, *IMAGE-SCREENING*, *ANALYSIS*,
*ANALYSIS-FEATURES*, *THUMBNAIL1*, *THUMBNAIL-BIG*

In this case, the follwing data set types will be available to the user:

*PROCESSED-DATA*, *ANALYSIS-FEATURES*, *THUMBNAIL-BIG*

### Configuring File Servlet

This service is specially tailored for web applications requiring to
upload files to the system without using the DataSet concept, it was
meant to be used for small images and rich text editors like CKEditor.

### Configuring DSS Data Sources

It is quite common that openBIS AS is using a database filled by DSS.
Depending on the DSS (specified by the DSS code) and the technology
different databases have to be used.

Configuration is best done by AS [core
plugins](../../software-developer-documentation/server-side-extensions/core-plugins.md) of type
`dss-data-sources`. The name of the plugin is just the DSS code. The
following properties of `plugin.properties` are recognized:

| Property Key                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| technology                                       | Normally the technology/module folder of the core plugin specifies the technology/module for which this data source has to be configured. If this is not the case this property allows to specify the technology/module independently.  |
| database-driver                                  | Fully qualified class name of the data base driver, e.g. `org.postgresql.Driver`.                                                                                                                                                        |
| database-url                                     | URL of the database, e.g. `jdbc:postgresql://localhost/imaging_dev`                                                                                                                                                                       |

Properties `database-driver` and `database-url` can be omitted if a
`etc/dss-datasource-mapping` is defined. For more see [Sharing
Databases](https://unlimited.ethz.ch/display/openBISDoc2010/Sharing+Databases).

### Changing the Capability-Role map

openBIS uses a map of capabilities to roles to decide what role is
needed to perform a given action. The defaults can be overridden by
creating a file `etc/capabilities`. One line in this file has one of the
following formats:

```
<Capability>: <Role>[,<ROLE>...]
<Capability>: <Role>[,<ROLE>...][; <Parameter> = <Role>[, <Role>...]][; <Parameter> = <Role>[, <Role>]] ...
<Capability>: <Parameter> = <Role>[, <Role>...][; <Parameter> = <Role>[, <Role>]] ...
```


which sets a new (minimal) role for the given capability. There is a
special role `INSTANCE_DISABLED` which allows to completely disable a
capability for an instance. Note: to set multiple roles for single
capability use multiple lines in the file.

This is the default map:

|Capability                      |Parameter|Default Role                       |Comment                                                                                                                                                                                        |

### Querying Project Database

In some customized versions of openBIS an additional project-specific
database is storing data from registered data sets. This database can be
queried via SQL Select statements in openBIS Web application. In order
to protect modification of this database by malicious SQL code openBIS
application server should access this database as a user which is member
of a read-only group. The name of this read-only group is project
specific.

```{note}
It is possible to configure openBIS to query multiple project-specific databases.
```

#### Create Read-Only User in PostgreSQL

A new user (aka role) is created by

```sql
CREATE ROLE <read-only user> LOGIN NOSUPERUSER INHERIT NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE;
```

This new user is added to the read-only group by the following command:

```sql
GRANT <read-only group> TO <read-only user>;
```

The name of the read-only group can be obtained by having a look into
the list of all groups:

```sql
SELECT * from PG_GROUP;
```

*Note that by default openBIS creates a user* ` openbis_readonly `
*which has read-only permissions to all database objects. You can use
this user to access the openBIS meta database through the openBIS query
interface.*

#### Enable Querying

To enable querying functionality for additional databases in openBIS Web  application a [core plugin](../../software-developer-documentation/server-side-extensions/core-plugins.md#core-plugins) of type query-databases has to be created. The following `plugin.properties` have to be specified:

| Property          | Description                                                                                                               |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| label             | Label of the database. It will be used in the Web application in drop down lists for adding / editing customized queries. |
| database-driver   | JDBC Driver of the database, e.g. org.postgresql.Driver for postgresql.                                                  |
| database-url      | JDBC URL to the database containing full database name, e.g. jdbc:postgresql://localhost/database_name for postgresql     |
| database-username | Above-mentioned defined read-only user.                                                                                  |
| database-password | Password of the read-only user.                                                                                          |

#### Configure Authorization

In order to configure authorization two additional properties can be
configured:

| Property                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <database>.data-space           | To which data-space this database belongs to (optional, i.e. a query database can be configured not to belong to one data space by leaving this configuration value empty). |
| <database>.creator-minimal-role | What role is required to be allowed to create / edit queries on this database (optional, default: INSTANCE_OBSERVER if data-space is not set, POWER_USER otherwise).       |

The given parameters data-space and creator-minimal-role are used by
openBIS to enforce proper authorization.

For example, if

    data-space = CISD
    creator-minimal-role = SPACE_ADMIN

is configured, then for the query database configured with key `db1`:

- only a `SPACE_ADMIN` on data space `CISD` and an `INSTANCE_ADMIN`
    are allowed to create / edit queries,
- only a user who has the `OBSERVER` role in data space `CISD` is
    allowed to execute a query.

For query databases that do not belong to a space but that have a column with any of the [magic column names](../../../user-documentation/general-admin-users/custom-database-queries.md#hyperlinks), the query result is filtered on a per-row basis according to what the user executing the query is allowed to see. In detail this means: if the user executing the query is not an instance admin, filter out all rows which belong to a data space where the user doesn't have a least the observer role. The relationship between a row and a data space is established by means of the experiment / sample / data set whose `permId` is given by one of the magical column names.

For sensitive data where authorization needs to be enforced, there are
two setups possible:

1. Configure a query database that **does not** belong to a data space
    and set the creator-minimal-role to `INSTANCE_ADMIN`. Any instance
    admin can be trusted to understand authorization issues and ensure
    that only queries are added for this query database that contain a
    proper reference to an experiment / sample / data set. This way, it
    can be ensured that only properly filtered query results are
    returned to the user running the query.
2. Configure a query database that **does** belong to a specific data
    space and set the creator-minimal-role to `POWER_USER`. The
    datastore server (or whatever server maintains the query database)
    ensures that only information related to the configured data space
    is added to the query database. Thus whatever query the power user
    writes for this database, it will only reveal information from this
    data space. As only users with `OBSERVER` role on this data space
    are allowed to execute the query, authorization is enforced properly
    without the need of filtering query results.

### Master data import/export

The master data of openBIS comprises all entity/property types, property
assignments, vocabularies etc. needed for your customized installation
to work. The system offers a way to export/import master data via Jython
scripts. More information on how to do create such scripts and run them
manually see the advanced guide [Jython Master Data Scripts](https://unlimited.ethz.ch/display/openBISDoc2010/Jython+Master+Data+Scripts#JythonMasterDataScripts-Commandlinetools).

A master data script can be run automatically by start up of the AS if
it is defined in an AS core plugin. The script path should be
`<installation directory>/servers/core-plugins/<module name>/<version number>/as/initialize-master-data.py`.
For more details about the folder structure of core plugins see [Core
Plugins](../../software-developer-documentation/server-side-extensions/core-plugins.md#core-plugins). If there are several
core plugins with master data scripts the scripts will be executed in
alphabetical order of the module names. For example, the master data
script of module `screening-optional` will be executed after the master
data script of module `screening` has been executed.

Execution of master data script can be suppressed by
disabling `initialize-master-data` core plugin. For more details see
[Core Plugins](../../software-developer-documentation/server-side-extensions/core-plugins.md).

### Limit of open files

When putting a lot of files in a drop box you might run into the problem
of  '`too many open files error`'. Please consider changing the ulimit
value (for RHEL6 edit `/etc/security/limits.conf` ) to a higher value.

### Runtime changes to logging

The
script  `<installation directory>/servers/openBIS-server/jetty/bin/configure.sh `can
be used to change the logging behavior of openBIS application server
while the server is running.

The script is used like this: configure.sh \[command\] \[argument\]

The table below describes the possible commands and their arguments.

| Command                              | Argument(s)                                            | Default Value | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

When this feature is enabled, openBIS will periodically create a report of all service calls that have been in execution more than 15 seconds to file <installation directory>/servers/openBIS-server/jetty/log/openbis_long_running_threads.txt.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| debug-db-connections                 | 'on', 'off'                                            | 'off'         | Turns on / off logging about database connection pool activity.
When this feature is enabled, information about every borrow and return to database connection pool is logged to openBIS main log in file <installation directory>/servers/openBIS-server/jetty/log/openbis_log.txt                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| log-db-connections                   | no argument / minimum connection age (in milliseconds) | 5000          | When this command is executed without an argument, information about every database connection that has been borrowed from the connection pool is written into openBIS main log in file <installation directory>/servers/openBIS-server/jetty/log/openbis_log.txt
If the "minimum connection age" argument is specified, only connections that have been out of the pool longer than the specified time are logged. The minimum connection age value is given in milliseconds. |
| record-stacktrace-db-connections     | 'on', 'off'                                            | 'off'         | Turns on / off logging of stacktraces.
When this feature is enabled AND debug-db-connections is enabled, the full stack trace of the borrowing thread will be recorded with the connection pool activity logs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

When this feature is disabled, the database connection pool activity logging is done only to openBIS main log. When this feature is enabled, the activity logging is done ALSO to file <installation directory>/servers/openBIS-server/jetty/log/openbis_db_connections.txt.                                                                                                                                |

 

### Deleted Entity History

Logging the history of deleted entities can be enabled / disabled in
service.properties using setting

entity-history.enabled = \[true | false\]

Since 20.10.1 the default value is true (meaning, entity history is
enabled). Before 20.10.1 the default value was false.

Deleted entity history can be queried with script show-history.sh, which
is located in $OPENBIS\_INSTALL\_DIR/bin

## Troubleshooting Problems

### Samples with datasets and no experiments

In the openBIS UI users could detach samples with container data sets
from the experiment. This bug was fix on version S176 released on 14 of
march of 2014.

The following SQL script lists all samples with data sets but no
experiments:

```sql
##
## SELECT SAMPLES WITH DATASETS AND NO EXPERIMENTS
##
SELECT s.id, d.expe_id from samples_all s join data_all d on (d.samp_id=s.id) where s.expe_id is null ORDER by s.id

If the last query shows no output the system is fine, if not, it can be
repaired with the following update query.

##
## FIX SAMPLES WITH DATASETS AND NO EXPERIMENTS ASSIGNING EXPERIMENT FROM DATASET
##
UPDATE samples_all
SET expe_id = subquery.expe_id
FROM (
    SELECT s.id as samp_id, d.expe_id as expe_id from samples_all s join data_all d on (d.samp_id=s.id) where s.expe_id is null
) as subquery
where id = subquery.samp_id
```
