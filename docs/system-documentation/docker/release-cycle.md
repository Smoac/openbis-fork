# Release Cycle

The official **openbis-server** images available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/openbis/) are tagged by major release published on the [openBIS download page](https://unlimited.ethz.ch/display/openbis/Production+Releases) with the latest bugfix patches included. The official openBIS installation package is based on the latest official image of [Ubuntu LTS Linux](https://releases.ubuntu.com). In addition, all containers are rebuilt and republished at least on a monthly basis to include operating system patches.
