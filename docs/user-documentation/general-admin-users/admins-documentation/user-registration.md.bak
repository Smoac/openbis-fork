For file-based authentication provide username and password. The password can later be changed by the user.

## Default roles assigned in ELN

When a user is registered via the ELN interface, a *Space* (folder) with
the name of the user is automatically created under the Lab Notebook
main menu. The user is also assigned some default roles:

1.  *Space admin* of the *Space* created for him/her under the notebook.
2.  *Space user of* the Inventory *Spaces* (MATERIALS, METHODS by
    default), the STOCK\_CATALOG and the STORAGE *Spaces*.
3.  *Space Observer* of the STOCK\_ORDERS, ELN\_SETTINGS and
    PUBLICATIONS S*paces*.


Modification to default rights can be granted by an *Instance admin*
from the *admin UI*, as explained below.

Overview of roles:
[openBIS Roles](./user-registration.md#openbis-roles)


## Register users from the admin UI


When users are registered via the admin UI no default roles are
assigned.
 

To register new users from the admin UI:

1.  go to the **Users** tab. The **Users** and **Groups** will show in
    the main menu on left had side.
2.  Click on **Users** in the menu: the **Add** button at the bottom of
    the menu will become active (blue)
3.  Click the **Add** button
4.   Enter the U**ser Id**. This is the LDAP username, when LDAP
    authentication is used, or the email address if SSO is used. Please
    note that file-based authentication (where username and password can
    be created) is not supported by the admin UI.
5.  **Home space**: this sets the default folder a user sees marked as
    **My Space** in the Lab Notebook.
6.  Click the **Add Role** button at the bottom of the page to assign a
    role to the user.
7.  Click the **Add Group** button at the bottom of the page to assign a

8. To assign a role to a user, first the **Level** needs to be selected
(Instance, Space, Project) .

## User Profile



In the User Profile, a user who is logged in into openBIS can find the
following information:

 

1.  **First Name**
2.  **Last Name**
3.  **Email**
4.  **openBIS session token**
5.  **Zenodo API Token** ([Export to
    Zenodo](../../../general-users/data-export.md#export-to-zenodo))

 

First name, last name and email are automatically filled in when LDAP or
SSO are used for authentication.

In case of file-based authentication, this information can be entered
here directly from the user.

 

![image info](img/Screenshot-2022-06-28-at-10.15.39.png)

 

For file-based authentication, users can also change their password
here, from the **Change Password** option under the **More..** dropdown.

## Assign home space to a user



 

When a home space is assigned to a user, this becomes marked as **My
Space** for that user in the lab notebook, as shown below.

 

![image info](img/menu-my-space.png)

 

When users are registered via the ELN UI, a *Space* with their username
is created (see [User
Registration)](./user-registration.md)
and this is automatically set as home space for the user.

The same happens in multi-group instances where spaces are created for
each user in the lab notebook section.

An *instance admin* can change the home space of a user or assign one to
a user that does not have a home space assigned from the admin UI, as
shown below.

 

![image info](img/home-space-admin-ui-1024x359.png)

 

Please note that when a user is inactivated, the home space assigned to
that user is moved in the ELN UI to the folder **Others (disabled).** If
this is not desired, the space should be removed as home space from the
inactivated user. This can be done by an *instance admin*.
