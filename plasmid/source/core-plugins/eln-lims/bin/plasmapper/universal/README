This is PlasMapper version 2.0.

Comparing to version 1.0,
1. I added 2 more spots for user to add user
defined features.
2. added genbank format output as users feedback.

how to update feature database
1. vector feature database is updated very often.
You will always need to reformat the feature database after
you update database in PlasMapper/dataBase/db_vectorFeature
directory by using the command:

formatdb -i features.fasta.nt -p F -o T

2. You will need to update the feature.html file in PlasMapper/html directory:
   you should replace the content between <pre></pre> tag by copy the content in the
   PlasMapper/dataBase/db_vectorFeature/features.fasta.nt
   file over

How to reconfigure PlasMapper:

Open PlasMapper/WEB-INF/classes/ca/ualberta/xdong/plasMapper/annotate/plasMapConfiguration_en_CA
.properties

to configure it to your server.
