/**
 * A component that manages a connection to openBIS and 1 or more data store servers.
 * <p>
 * The component is a kind of state machine. In the initial state, only login is allowed. After login, other operations may be called. Thus clients
 * should follow the following usage pattern:
 * <ol>
 * <li>login</li>
 * <li>...do stuff...</li>
 * <li>logout</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * The IDssComponent itself is designed to be used in a single thread, though it may return objects that can be used in multiple threads.
 * Documentation for the return values clarifies their level of thread safety.
