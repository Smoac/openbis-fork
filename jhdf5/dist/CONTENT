Library

  lib/jhdf5-core.jar: 
    The Java class files of the JHDF5 library. Requires commons-io.jar, commons-lang.jar,  
    cisd-base.jar and cisd-args4j.jar on the class path. Requires the native libraries to be 
    provided separately (see below at lib/native).

  lib/jhdf5-tools.jar: 
    The Java class files of the JHDF5 archiver. It can be used like 'java -jar jhdf5-tools.jar'. 
    Requires commons-io.jar, commons-lang.jar, cisd-base.jar, cisd-args4j.jar and cisd-core.jar on 
    the class path. Requires the native libraries to be provided separately (see below at lib/native).

  lib/jhdf5.jar: 
    All Java class files packaged in one jar file. Requires the native libraries to be provided 
    separately. 

  lib/batteries_included:
    Includes all Java class files of the JHDF5 library and the JHDF5 archiver and all native 
    libraries necessary to use JHDF5.
    No other file is needed when using one of these jar files. 

	  All supported platforms:
	    lib/batteries_included/jhdf5-batteries_included_lin_win_mac_sun.jar 
	  
	  Linux/MacOSX/Windows, but no Sun Solaris: 
	    lib/batteries_included/jhdf5-batteries_included_lin_win_mac_sun.jar
	    
  lib/native:
    The native libraries are provided in two forms: 
      * as jar files, one jar file per platform (actually two platforms: 32bit and 64bit), e.g. 
    		jhdf5-linux-intel.jar has the shared libraries for Linux on Intel/AMD. Note that these jar 
    		files do not contain the Java class files. In order to use these files, ensure that the jar 
    		file for your platform is in the class path.
      * as files in folders jhdf5 and unix. In order to use them ensure that you point the Java 
        property native.libpath to the root of this hierarchy, 
        e.g.: "-Dnative.libpath=/home/tim/lib/native"
        Note that instead of native.libpath the default Java property java.library.path can be set, 
        but in this case no automatic resolution of the platform is provided.
