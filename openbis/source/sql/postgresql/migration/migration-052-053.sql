-- Migration from 052 to 053

-- Change code uniqueness check for samples of specific type.
-- If sample_types.is_subcode_unique flag is set to 'true', codes of samples of the type will have to
-- be unique no matter if they are contained in a container or not. Otherwise standard uniqueness 
-- check is performed (taking container connection into consideration).
