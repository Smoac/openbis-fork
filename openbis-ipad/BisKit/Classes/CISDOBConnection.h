/**
 *  \brief A connection to an openBIS server.
 * 
 *  The connection is an abstract superclass.
 *  There are two concrete subclasses:
 *      - CISDOBLiveConnection -- a connection that runs over the network
 *      - CISDOBPlaybackConnection -- a simulated connection that responds to requests 
 *        by returning data that was previously saved to a file. Useful for testing.
 * 
 *  The methods on the connection do not immidiately execute the call. Instead, they return call objects that can be configured.
 *  Typical configuration will include setting the success and fail blocks.
