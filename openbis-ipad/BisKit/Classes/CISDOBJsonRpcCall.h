/**
 *  \brief A call to a JSON-RPC service. 
 * 
 *  The design is based on the jquery ajaxRequest object.
 *  This object makes a call to a JSON-RPC service and invokes
 *  the success or fail block as a result as appropriate.
 * 
 *  The fail block is called when there are problems either 
 *  with the invocation/transport or if the json-rpc call resulted 
 *  in an error. If the problem was with the transport, the error 
 *  will probably be in the NSURLErrorDomain. If the call returned
 *  an error, the error will be in the CISOBJsonRpcErrorDomain domain.
 *  See the documentation of the CISOBJsonRpcErrorCode enum to see what is
 *  in the userInfo dictionary.
 * 
 *  If the call was successful and returned a non-error result, the success block is called.
 *
 *  All properties are expected to be non-nil before start is called, 
 *  unless it is nil values are explicitly allowed. In particular, success, and fail are expected to be non-nil.
