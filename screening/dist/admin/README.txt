The folder contains administration scripts that are now being distributed with the installation
tarballs.

We will keep the folder temporarily to ease transition from the old-style installations, but 
in the future this folder should be deleted.

If you decide to remove the folder, please remove the folder "openbis/dist/admin" too. It is 
essentially the same thing, but for the generic openBIS installation.

Deadlines
- the contents of the folder are deprecated since S113 (mid August 2011)
- we should delete this folder until the end of 2011
