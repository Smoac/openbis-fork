<H2>Configure openBIS PostgreSQL DB</H2>

<BR>    
openBIS requires PostgreSQL installation to be configured with the 'trust' setting on localhost, which 
means that a user connecting from 127.0.0.1 can connect without providing a password.
 
These settings are changed in the file pg_hba.conf, 
see <A href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html</A>
    
Click 'Next' to verify the users 'postgres' and '$USER_HOME' can connect to a PostgreSQL server running on localhost.
