Screening Images Patch
======================

The big refactoring and bug fixes concerning screening images done on trunk 
in September and October 2014 has been backported to stage (r32570, r32586, r32587).

A descision was made to revert this backporting (r32655, r32665, r32666). 

Patches for the projects common, datastore_server, and screening have been created 
to bring the big screening images code changes back on stage. 

All three patch files should be applied for the corresponding project. 
In addition the testdata should be replaced by unziping testdata.zip.
