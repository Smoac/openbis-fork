This folder contains libraries (JAR files) that are not part of the standard 
openBIS installation, but are needed for the normal work of the system.

One good example for such libraries are JDBC drivers required to connect to 
an external database (e.g. Oracle). 

Administrators are encouraged to copy the extension libraries here as they will 
be kept by the openBIS upgrade scripts (as opposed to the contents of the 'lib'
folder which are wiped out after a software upgrade).
