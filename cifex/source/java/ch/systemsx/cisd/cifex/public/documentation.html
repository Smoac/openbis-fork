<h2><a name="FAQ-1"></a>I forgot my password, how can I receive a new one?</h2>

<p>If you are a temporary user, you should contact the person who created the account for you,
to set a new password.</p>

<p>If you are a permanent user or don't know who created the account for you, you can contact
the administrator of the system, which is listed on the footer of the website.</p>

<h2><a name="FAQ-2"></a>I have not received the mail with my login and password, were can I get
it from?</h2>

<p>First have a look in your spam filter, perhaps the mail is there.</p>

<p>If you can't access these mails or the mail is not there, you should contact the person, who
wants to share the files with you or the one who created your temporary account. This person can
reset your password. When you login to CIFEX next time, please change this password!</p>

<p>If you are a permanent user or don't know who created the account for you, you should contact
the administrator of the system, which is listed on the footer of the website.</p>

<h2><a name="FAQ-3"></a>I don't have the link to the file to download anymore. Where can I get
it from?</h2>

<p>You don't need the link to the file, you simply can login to CIFEX and there you have a
complete list with all files which are available for you.</p>

<p>If you don't have a password to access the system, please have a look on the FAQ entry "I
have not received the mail with my login and password. Were can I get it from?"</p>

<h2><a name="FAQ-4"></a>How can I set the password of temporary users I created?</h2>

<p>In the main view you have a list of users you have created. In the last column is a link with
the value edit, which opens a new Window with a form to edit the user. If you leave the password
field empty, the password is not changed and the last password will be kept. So be aware that you
have to fill out the password field, to set a new password and don't forget to notify the user about
the changes (Checkbox in the form).</p>

<h2><a name="FAQ-5"></a>How can I change a list of users with whom my file has been shared?</h2>

<p>Use 'Edit sharing' link in the 'Files I have uploaded' section.</p>

<h2><a name="FAQ-6"></a>I want to share confidential files, what do I need to consider?</h2>

<p>Email addresses are not guaranteed to be unique in CIFEX, which means that in principle two
or more CIFEX user accounts could share the same email address. This doesn't make sense but a
malicious user of the system could change the email address of his CIFEX account to the email addess
of someone you want to share a file with. If you use such a non-unique email address on file upload,
all of the users sharing the email address would get access to the file.</p>

<p>If you want to share your file only with one of the users that has assigned the given email
address, you can specify the user name in the file upload form with the prefix 'id:'. So if you want
to upload a file for user 'x' with the mail a@abc.com, you can specify 'id:x' in the Recipients
field and thus you can be sure that only user 'x' will get access to the file.</p>

<p>If you know just the email address but not the user name, you can add the email address to
the Recipients field and click on 'Validate users' button. A window will appear and all the
information about the users connected to the email addresses you entered will be displayed. You can
add more users or select only those you want to share the file with.</p>

<p>Note that the person who registered an account is able to change it's password and this way
may get access to the files shared with it. Check if the registrator is a person you trust. Should
this not be the case, you'd better create a new temporary CIFEX account for your colleague and use
that new account to share your files with.</p>

<h2><a name="FAQ-7"></a>A user with this email address already exists, but it is not the one I
want to share the file with!</h2>

<p>If you want to upload a file for an email address which already exists in CIFEX but does not
belong to the user you want to share the file with, you should create a new temporary user account
with this email address. Thanks to the fact, that the mail addresses are not unique, this is
possible. Now you can specify the user name in the upload field with the prefix 'id:' or just enter
the email address and do 'Validate Users' and only select the temporary user you created.</p>

<h2><a name="FAQ-8"></a>I'm trying to log in using my LDAP/University/other external account,
but the system does not let me in.</h2>

<p>In certain configurations CIFEX allows logging in using an <i>"external authentication"</i>
system (like LDAP) as well as using the <i>"internal (build-in) authentication"</i> system (which
in this setup is mostly used for temporary accounts). Not being able to log in using external
username and password indicates that your account has been used to create a temporary CIFEX user
account. In this case, please contact the administrator of your CIFEX installation.</p>

<h2><a name="FAQ-9"></a>I already have a CIFEX account, but would like to use the same password
that I use for LDAP/University/other external account.</h2>

<p>Just log in with your temporary password, click <i>"External authentication"</i> option and
type your password as stored in the external authentication system.</p>
