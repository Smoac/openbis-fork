<h2><a name="FAQ-Iforgotmypassword%2ChowcanIreceiveanewone%3F"></a>I forgot my password, how can I receive a new one?</h2>

<p>If you are a temporary user, you should contact the person who created the account for you, to set a new password.</p>

<p>If you are a permanent user or don't know who created the account for you, you can contact the administrator of the system, which is listed on the footer of the website.</p>

<h2><a name="FAQ-Ihavenotreceivedthemailwithmyloginandpassword%2CwerecanIgetitfrom%3F"></a>I have not received the mail with my login and password, were can I get it from?</h2>

<p>First have a look in your spam filter, perhaps the mail is there.</p>

<p>If you can't access these mails or the mail is not there, you should contact the person, who wants to share the files with you or the on who created your temporary account. This person can reset your password. When you next time login to Cifex, please change this password!</p>

<p>If you are a permanent user or don't know who created the account for you, you can contact the administrator of the system, which is listed on the footer of the website.</p>

<h2><a name="FAQ-Idon%27thavethelinktothefiletodownloadanymore.WherecanIgetitfrom%3F"></a>I don't have the link to the file to download anymore. Where can I get it from?</h2>

<p>You don't need the link to the file, you simply can login to Cifex and there you have a complete list with all files which are available for you.</p>

<p>If you don't have a password to access the system, please have a look on the FAQ entry "I have not received the mail with my login and password. Were can I get it from?"</p>

<h2><a name="FAQ-HowcanIsetthepasswordoftemporaryusersIcreated%3F"></a>How can I set the password of temporary users I created?</h2>

<p>In the main view you have a list of users you have created. In the last column is a link with the value edit, which opens a new Window with a form to edit the user. If you leave the password field empty, the password is not changed and the last password will be kept. So be aware that you have to fill out the password field, to set a new password and don't forget to notify the user about the changes (Checkbox in the form).</p>

<h2><a name="FAQ-HowcanIchangealistofuserswithwhommyfilehasbeenshared%3F"></a>How can I change a list of users with whom my file has been shared?</h2>

<p>Use 'Edit sharing' link in the 'Files I have uploaded' section.</p>
