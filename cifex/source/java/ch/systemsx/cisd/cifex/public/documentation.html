<h2><a name="FAQ-Iforgotmypassword%2ChowcanIreceiveanewone%3F"></a>I forgot my password, how can I receive a new one?</h2>

<p>If you are a temporary user, you should contact the person who created the account for you, to set a new password.</p>

<p>If you are a permanent user or don't know who created the account for you, you can contact the administrator of the system, which is listed on the footer of the website.</p>

<h2><a name="FAQ-Ihavenotreceivedthemailwithmyloginandpassword%2CwerecanIgetitfrom%3F"></a>I have not received the mail with my login and password, were can I get it from?</h2>

<p>First have a look in your spam filter, perhaps the mail is there.</p>

<p>If you can't access these mails or the mail is not there, you should contact the person, who wants to share the files with you or the on who created your temporary account. This person can reset your password. When you next time login to Cifex, please change this password!</p>

<p>If you are a permanent user or don't know who created the account for you, you can contact the administrator of the system, which is listed on the footer of the website.</p>

<h2><a name="FAQ-Idon%27thavethelinktothefiletodownloadanymore.WherecanIgetitfrom%3F"></a>I don't have the link to the file to download anymore. Where can I get it from?</h2>

<p>You don't need the link to the file, you simply can login to Cifex and there you have a complete list with all files which are available for you.</p>

<p>If you don't have a password to access the system, please have a look on the FAQ entry "I have not received the mail with my login and password. Were can I get it from?"</p>

<h2><a name="FAQ-HowcanIsetthepasswordoftemporaryusersIcreated%3F"></a>How can I set the password of temporary users I created?</h2>

<p>In the main view you have a list of users you have created. In the last column is a link with the value edit, which opens a new Window with a form to edit the user. If you leave the password field empty, the password is not changed and the last password will be kept. So be aware that you have to fill out the password field, to set a new password and don't forget to notify the user about the changes (Checkbox in the form).</p>

<h2><a name="FAQ-HowcanIchangealistofuserswithwhommyfilehasbeenshared%3F"></a>How can I change a list of users with whom my file has been shared?</h2>

<p>Use 'Edit sharing' link in the 'Files I have uploaded' section.</p>

<h2><a name="FAQ-HowcanIgetsure%2CthattherightusergetsmyfileIhaveuploaded%3F"></a>How can I get sure, that the right user gets my file I have uploaded?</h2>

<p>In our system, the email address is not unique. So it can be, that several user exist with the same email address and all of them get the file you uploaded to the email address.</p>

<p>For this reason you can also specify the user name in the file upload with the prefix 'id:'. So if you want to upload a file to user 'a' with the mail a@abc.com, you can specify 'id:a' in the Recipients field and only user 'a' receives the file.</p>

<p>If you don't know what the user name but the mail address, you can add the email address into the Recipients field and 'Validate users'. Then a DialogBox opens which shows you all user information of the users, which users belong to the email addresses you entered into the field. Here you can add more users and select only the users you want to share the file with.</p>

<h2><a name="FAQ-Auserwiththisemailadressealreadyexist%2CbutitisnottheoneIwanttosharethefilewith%21"></a>A user with this email address already exist, but it is not the one I want to share the file with!</h2>

<p>If you want to upload a file for a email address which already exist in Cifex but does not belong to the user you want to share the file with, you should create a new temporary user account with this email address. Due to the fact, that the mail addresses are not unique, this is possible. Now you can specify the user name in the upload field with the prefix 'id:' or just enter the email address and do 'Validate Users' and only select the temporary user you created.</p>

<h2><a name="FAQ-Iwanttoshareafilewithuserwithaspecificemailaddress%2Cbutforthisemailaddressseveralusersexist%21"></a>I want to share a file with user with a specific email address, but for this email address several users exist!</h2>

<p>It can really happen, that for a email address several users exist, due to the fact the the mail address is not unique.</p>

<p>For this you can add the email address into the 'Recipients' field and 'Validate Users'. A Dialog Box opens and you can only select the users you want to share the file with.</p>

<h2><a name="FAQ-I%27mtryingtologinusingmyLDAP%2FUniversity%2Fotherexternalaccount%2Cbutthesystemdoesnotletmein."></a>I'm trying to log in using my LDAP/University/other external account, but the system does not let me in.</h2>

<p>In certain configurations CIFEX allows logging in through <em>external</em> systems (like LDAP) as well as with <em>internal</em> authentication system (mostly used for temporary accounts). Not being able to log in using external username and password is a sign, that account with your username has already been taken by some temporary user. In such cases, please contact the administrator of your CIFEX installation.</p>

<h2><a name="FAQ-IalreadyhaveaCIFEXaccount%2CbutwouldliketousethesamepasswordthatIuseforLDAP%2FUniversity%2Fotherexternalaccount."></a>I already have a CIFEX account, but would like to use the same password that I use for LDAP/University/other external account. </h2>

<p>Just log in with your temporary password, click <em>External authentication</em> option and type your password.</p>
