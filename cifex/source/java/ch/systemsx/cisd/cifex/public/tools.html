<p>We have made several tools available for interacting with CIFEX: a GUI Upload 
application, a GUI Download appliation, and a command-line client.</p>
<p>All of these applications have advantages over the web interface. For example, they allow resumption
of incomplete uploads/download, and they perform more robust error-checking. The command-line client
can be easily scripted and lends itself to repetitive tasks.</p>
<p>
All these programms may be downloaded here:
