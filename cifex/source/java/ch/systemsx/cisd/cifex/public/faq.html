<h2><a name="FAQ-1"></a>I forgot my password, how can I receive a
new one?</h2>

<p>If you are a temporary user, you should contact the person who
created the account for you, to set a new password.</p>

<p>If you are a permanent user or don't know who created the account
for you, you can contact the user support or administrator of the system. 
The help page has a link for contacting the support / administrator.</p>

<br/>
<h2><a name="FAQ-2"></a>I have not received the mail with my login
and password, were can I get it from?</h2>

<p>First have a look in your spam filter, perhaps the mail is there.</p>

<p>If you can't access these mails or the mail is not there, you
should contact the person, who wants to share the files with you or the
one who created your temporary account. This person can reset your
password. When you login to CIFEX next time, please change this
password!</p>

<p>If you are a permanent user or don't know who created the account
for you, you should contact the administrator of the system. The help
page has a link for contacting the administrator.</p>

<br/>
<h2><a name="FAQ-3"></a>I don't have the link to the file to
download anymore. Where can I get it from?</h2>

<p>You don't need the link to the file, you simply can login to
CIFEX and look at your inbox. There you have a complete list with all
files which are available for you to download.</p>

<p>If you don't have a password to access the system, please have a
look on the FAQ entry "I have not received the mail with my login and
password. Were can I get it from?"</p>

<br/>
<h2><a name="FAQ-4"></a>How can I set the password of a temporary
user that I have created?</h2>

<p>In the <b>Share</b> view you have a list of users you have
created. In the last column is a link with the value edit, which opens a
new window with a form to edit the user. If you leave the password field
empty, the password is not changed and the last password will be kept.
Be aware that you have to fill out the password field to set a new
password, and don't forget to notify the user about the changes
(checkbox in the form).</p>

<br/>
<h2><a name="FAQ-5"></a>How can I change the list of users with
whom my file has been shared?</h2>

<p>Use <b>Edit sharing</b> link in the <b>Shared Files</b> section
of the <b>Share</b> view.</p>

<h2><a name="FAQ-6"></a>I want to share confidential files, what do
I need to consider?</h2>

<p><em>For strictly confidential files, it is recommended that you apply strong 
encryption to the files before uploading them to the CIFEX server! Make sure 
only the valid recipient of the file knows the encryption key.</em></p>

<p><u>Hint:</u> You may want to have a look at software like 
<a href="http://gnupg.org/">GNU Privacy Guard</a> or 
<a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/">TrueCrypt</a> for 
this purpose.</p>

<p>In general it should be noted that email addresses are not guaranteed to 
be unique in CIFEX, which means that in principle two or more CIFEX user 
accounts could share the same email address. This usually doesn't make sense 
but it can happen either by mistake or a malicious user of the system could 
change the email address of his CIFEX account to the email address of someone 
you want to share a file with. If you use such a non-unique email address on
file upload, all of the users sharing the email address would get access to 
the file!</p>

<p>If you want to share your file only with one of the users that
has assigned the given email address, you can specify the user name in
the share files form with the prefix 'id:'. So if you want to upload a
file for user 'x' with the mail a@abc.com, you can specify 'id:x' in the
Recipients field and thus you can be sure that only user 'x' will get
access to the file.</p>

<p>If you know just the email address but not the user name, you can
add the email address to the Recipients field and click on 'Validate
users' button. A window will appear and all the information about the
users connected to the email addresses you entered will be displayed.
You can add more users or select only those you want to share the file
with.</p>

<p>Note that the user who created a temporary account is able to access
all files uploaded by this account. Check if the creator is a person 
you trust. Should this not be the case, you'd better create a new temporary 
CIFEX account for your colleague yourself and use that new account to share 
your files.</p>

<br/>
<h2><a name="FAQ-7"></a>A user with this email address already
exists, but it is not the one I want to share the file with!</h2>

<p>If you want to share a file with someone who has an email address
that already exists in CIFEX but does not belong to the user you want to
share the file with, you should create a new temporary user account with
this email address. Thanks to the fact that the mail addresses are not
unique, this is possible. Now you can specify the user name in the
upload field with the prefix 'id:' or just enter the email address and
do 'Validate Users' and only select the temporary user you created.</p>

<br/>
<h2><a name="FAQ-8"></a>I'm trying to log in using my
LDAP/University/other external account, but the system does not allow me
in.</h2>

<p>In certain configurations CIFEX allows logging in using an <i>"external
authentication"</i> system (like LDAP) as well as using the <i>"internal
(build-in) authentication"</i> system (which in this setup is mostly used
for temporary accounts). Not being able to log in using external
username and password indicates that your account has been used to
create a temporary CIFEX user account. In this case, please contact the
administrator of your CIFEX server.</p>

<br/>
<h2><a name="FAQ-9"></a>I already have a CIFEX account, but would
like to use the same password that I use for LDAP/University/other
external account.</h2>

<p>Ask the CIFEX server administrator to switch the server to use 
the external authentication source for the server and to switch 
your account to <i>"External authentication"</i>.</p>

<br/>
<h2><a name="FAQ-10"></a>How to upload and download files larger than 2
Gigabytes?</h2>

<p>Web browsers only support uploading files smaller then 2 GB. For some web 
browsers this limit applies also for downloads. In order to share larger files, 
CIFEX provides two small Java Web Start&#153; applications, one for upload and 
one for download. To use these applications, just click on the link in the section 
<b>Upload Files with CIFEX Uploader</b> of the <b>Share</b> view or <b>Download Files 
with CIFEX Downloader</b> of the <b>Inbox</b> view, respectively. As a prerequisite, 
a Java&#153; Runtime Environment 5 (or higher) has to be installed on your 
computer.</p>

<p><u>Hint:</u> You do not need to specify the recipients when you
upload files with this application. They can be specified after
uploading by clicking on the corresponding link <b>Edit sharing</b> in
the table of uploaded files.</p>

<br/>
<h2><a name="FAQ-11"></a>How to upload and download files from the
command line?</h2>

<p>Download the CIFEX command line client from <a href="/cifex_cli.zip">the server</a>. 
This client supports uploading and downloading of files. It is particularly handy when 
uploading files from a server or downloading them to a server that does not have a 
window manager running.</p>

<p><u>Hint:</u> You may want to have a look at a terminal multiplexer like 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">GNU Screen</a> when starting 
a long-running upload and download on a server and want to disconnect while 
the process is still running.</p>

<br/>
<h2><a name="FAQ-12"></a>Is there a way to resume a long upload 
or download if it gets interrupted, e.g. due to a network failure?</h2>

<p>Resuming an upload or download that got interrupted by a network or 
computer failure is only possible when using the Java Web Start&#153; 
based CIFEX Uploader or CIFEX Downloader, or the CIFEX command line client. 
In this case the resume happens automatically. There is no resume 
capability for browser-based uploads or downloads due to principal 
limitations of how browsers can interact with your local file system. 
For a download, you need to make sure to set the download location of the 
download to the same directory that you used for the first download attempt.</p>
