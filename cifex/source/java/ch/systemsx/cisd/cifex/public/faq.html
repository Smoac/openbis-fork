<h2><a name="FAQ-no-storage-service">Should I rely on CIFEX as file storage service?</a></h2>

<p>CIFEX is <i>not</i> a file storage or backup service. It will delete files automatically 
after they have expired. <b>Always keep a copy of your valuable data that you have uploaded to 
CIFEX.</b> If you want to hand over important files using CIFEX, always keep a copy of the files 
locally until your file-sharing partner has confirmed that he successfully downloaded them.</p>

<br/>
<h2><a name="FAQ-forgotten-password"></a>I forgot my password, how can I receive a
new one?</h2>

<p>If you are a temporary user, you should contact the person who
created the account for you, to set a new password.</p>

<p>If you are a permanent user or don't know who created the account
for you, you can contact the user support or administrator of the system. 
The help page has a link for contacting the support / administrator.</p>

<br/>
<h2><a name="FAQ-didnt-get-account-email"></a>I am a temporary user and have not received the mail 
with my login and password, were can I get it from?</h2>

<p>First have a look in your spam filter, perhaps the mail got stuck there.</p>

<p>If this does not help, you should contact the person who wants to share files with you or the
one who created your temporary account. This person can reset your
password to a know value. When you login to CIFEX next time, please change this
password!</p>

<br/>
<h2><a name="FAQ-lost-link-to-file"></a>I don't have the link to the file to
download anymore. Where can I get it from?</h2>

<p>You don't need the link to the file, you simply can login to
CIFEX and look at your inbox. There you have a complete list with all
files which are available for you to download.</p>

<p>If you don't have a password to access the system, please have a
look on the FAQ entry "I have not received the mail with my login and
password. Were can I get it from?"</p>

<br/>
<h2><a name="FAQ-set-password-of-temp-user"></a>How can I set the password of a temporary
user that I have created?</h2>

<p>In the <b>Invite</b> view you get a list of users you have
created. In the last column is a link with the value <b>Edit</b>, which opens a
new window with a form to edit the user. If you leave the password field
empty, the password is not changed and the last password will be kept.
Be aware that you have to fill out the password field to set a new
password, and don't forget to notify the user about the changes
(checkbox in the form).</p>

<br/>
<h2><a name="FAQ-change-file-sharing-users"></a>How can I change the list of users with
whom my file is shared?</h2>

<p>Use <b>Edit sharing</b> link in the <b>Shared Files</b> section
of the <b>Share</b> view.</p>

<h2><a name="FAQ-confidential-files"></a>I want to share confidential files, what do
I need to consider?</h2>

<p><strong>For confidential files, it is recommended that you apply strong 
encryption to the files before uploading them to the CIFEX server! Make sure 
that you choose a <a href="http://www.queen.clara.net/pgp/pass.html">good passphrase</a> and that only 
the valid recipients of the file know it.</strong></p>

<p>The CIFEX Java Web Start&#153; and command line clients have built-in support for strong encryption 
using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">OpenPGP</a> standard using a 
symmetric key and an AES-128 cipher algorithm. Whenever you enter a passphrase in one of the CIFEX 
clients at upload, the files will be encrypted into an OpenPGP file (file extension <code>.pgp</code>).
The WebStart client can generate strong passphrases for you. It is important to keep these passphrases
or else nobody will be able to decrypt the files again. Note that the server is not involved in 
encryption or decryption in any way and has no information on whether or how a file is encrypted 
apart from the file extension. Using CIFEX built-in encryption you get pretty much the same as if 
you had called <a href="http://gnupg.org/">GNU Privacy Guard</a> (an OpenPGP compliant free 
software program) with
<pre>$ gpg -c --cipher-alg=aes128 &lt;file&gt;</code></pre>
prior to the upload.</p>

<p><u>Hint:</u> Another useful software program for strong encryption is 
<a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/">TrueCrypt</a>.</p>

<p>In the context of confidentiality it should be noted that email addresses are 
not guaranteed to be unique in CIFEX, which means that two or more CIFEX user 
accounts can share the same email address. In order to avoid sharing files with a user account you
do not intend to share the file with, it is safest to specify the user id (use prefix <code>id:</code>) 
instead of the email address as the user id is guaranteed to be unique. If you know just the email 
address but not the user name, you can add the email address to the Recipients field and click 
on 'Validate Users' button. A window will appear and all the information about the
users connected to the email addresses you entered will be displayed.
You can add more users or un-select some of the selected users that you do not want to share the 
file with.</p>

<p>Note that the user who created a temporary account is able to access
all files uploaded by that temporary account. For that reason, temporary accounts created by other 
users than yourself are not considered when resolving emails to user ids. If you specify the user id
of a temporary account, first check if the creator is a person you trust. Should this not be the 
case, you'd better create a new temporary CIFEX account for your colleague yourself and use that 
new account to share your files.</p>

<br/>
<h2><a name="FAQ-user-with-email-already-exists"></a>A user with this email address already
exists, but it is not the one I want to share the file with!</h2>

<p>If you want to share a file with someone who has an email address
that already exists in CIFEX but does not belong to the user you want to
share the file with, you should create a new temporary user account with
this email address. Thanks to the fact that the mail addresses are not
unique, this is possible. Now you can specify the user name in the
upload field with the prefix 'id:' or just enter the email address and
do 'Validate Users' and only select the temporary user you created.</p>

<br/>
<h2><a name="FAQ-institutional-account-doesnt-work"></a>I'm trying to log in for the first time 
using my institutional account (LDAP service or similar), but CIFEX says <i>"Sorry, you entered an 
invalid user or password."</i>.What't up?</h2>

<p>Most likely another user has created a temporary account with your external account name for you.
This temporary account now shadows your external account account. Either use the password you received
by email to access the temporary account and wait until the temporary account expired (after that 
time your external account's password will work), or ask the administrator / support to switch your 
account to external authentication.</p>

<br/>
<h2><a name="FAQ-2gb-filesize-limit"></a>How to upload and download files larger than 2
Gigabytes?</h2>

<p>Web browsers only support uploading files smaller then 2 GB. For some web 
browsers this limit applies also for downloads. In order to share larger files, 
CIFEX provides two small Java Web Start&#153; applications, one for upload and 
one for download. To use these applications, just click on the link in the section 
<b>Upload Files with CIFEX Uploader</b> of the <b>Share</b> view or <b>Download Files 
with CIFEX Downloader</b> of the <b>Inbox</b> view, respectively. As a prerequisite, 
a Java&#153; Runtime Environment 5 (or higher) has to be installed on your 
computer.</p>

<p><u>Hint:</u> You do not need to specify the recipients when you
upload files with this application. They can be specified after
uploading by clicking on the corresponding link <b>Edit sharing</b> in
the table of uploaded files.</p>

<br/>
<h2><a name="FAQ-command-line"></a>How to upload and download files from the
command line?</h2>

<p>Download the <a href="/cifex_cli.zip">CIFEX command line client</a>. 
This client supports listing, uploading, downloading and deleting of files. It is particularly handy 
when uploading files from a server or downloading them to a server that does not have a 
window manager running. The command line client supports also some auxiliary functions useful in 
the context of CIFEX like computing a CRC32 checksum and encrypting or decrypting files.</p>

<p><u>Hint:</u> You may want to have a look at a terminal multiplexer like 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">GNU Screen</a> when starting 
a long-running upload and download on a server and want to disconnect while 
the process is still running.</p>

<br/>
<h2><a name="FAQ-resume-uploads-downloads"></a>Is there a way to resume a long upload 
or download if it gets interrupted, e.g. due to a network failure?</h2>

<p>Resuming an upload or download that got interrupted by a network or 
computer failure is only possible when using the Java Web Start&#153; 
based CIFEX Uploader or CIFEX Downloader, or the CIFEX command line client. 
In this case the resume happens automatically. There is no resume 
capability for browser-based uploads or downloads due to principal 
limitations of how browsers can interact with your local file system. 
For a download, you need to make sure to set the download location of the 
download to the same directory that you used for the first download attempt.</p>
